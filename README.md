# CodingBat Solutions

This repository contains solutions to [CodingBat Python challenges](https://codingbat.com/python), solved using Haskell.

## Directory Structure

- **src/**: Contains the Haskell solution files.
- **test/**: Contains the test files for the solutions.

## Running the Tests

1. Install Haskell and Cabal if not already installed. You can follow the instructions [here](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/).

2. Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justromeon/codingbat.git
   cd codingbat

3. Install dependencies and build the project:
    ```bash
    cabal update
    cabal build

4. Running the test
    ```bash
    cabal test

This will run all the test cases in the test directory.
